Metadata Catalog
===

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cires-ncei/metadata-catalog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cires-ncei/metadata-catalog)

The intent of this project is to build a scalable system for storing canonical records of granule- and collection-level metadata to centralize metadata management and enable various ETL workflows.

## Artifacts

The travis build with automatically create snapshots of the images and full system docker-compose file (on Docker hub and JFrog Artifactory respectively).

To build and promote a set of snapshot artifacts, run ```bash promote.sh <version> <next version>```. Do not include the leading 'v' required by the tag in ```<version>``` - the script will add it automatically. This will make several commits: one to update the versions in the docker-compose and gradle.properties, one to tag the commit with the version (which triggers the build), and another to update the versions in the files again to reduce the likelihood of accidentally leaving versions the same and stepping on them later.

Any tag that begins with 'v' (case sensitive) is treated as a version and triggers the promotion part of the build. Manual promotion of artifacts can be accomplished by creating such a tag.

### Manual promotion

Prefer automatic promotion of artifacts over manual, but if more control is needed of which artifacts to promote or how to label the versions, these commands will allow that.

Command to manually promote an existing file:

curl -X POST -u "$bintrayUser:$bintrayKey" -H "Content-Length: 0\
  "http://oss.jfrog.org/api/plugins/build/promote/snapshotsToBintray/metadata-catalog/$travisBuildNumber?params=releaseVersion=$baseVersion"

Note that the snapshot build number is the same as the travis build number, which should make it easier to identify which build to promote. However, not all builds create snapshots - be sure the build of interest actually produced a snapshot or look in the snapshot repository.

To manually promote docker images, make sure the image of interest has been downloaded to your machine. Then run:

docker login
docker tag imagename:oldversion imagename:newversion
docker push imagename:newversion
docker logout

If you want the 'latest' tag on the image to reference the new version, repeat the above set of commands with 'latest' as the newversion.

## Deployment

The storage, index, and api modules are each running in their own container using spring's default port.  Only the api module has that port exposed externally.

NOTE: Make sure to do a clean if you make any changes to docker or gradle files.

* `./gradlew clean buildDeployment`
* `docker-compose -f build/docker-compose.yml -p metadata up -d`

### Verification of Containers Running
#### Storage Container
* `curl localhost:8081/collections`
#### Index Container
* `curl localhost:8082/search`
#### API Container
* `curl localhost:8083/index/search`
* `curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"collection_name": "collectionFace", "collection_schema": "a collection schema", "type":"fos", "collection_metadata": "{blah:blah}", "geometry": "point()"}' localhost:8083/storage1/collections`
* `curl localhost:8083/storage1/collections`
